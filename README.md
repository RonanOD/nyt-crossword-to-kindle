# nyt-crossword-to-kindle <!-- omit in toc -->

Takes NYT Crosswords and sends them straight to your Kindle for your e-ink solving pleasure! Tried to make this as simple as possible so that even the layperson with technology can get to solving.

Starting as a basic, thrown together project for my wife, I wanted to make this available to the world for others to partake in. The NYTGames app is great, but there's nothing quite like writing the crosswords out on "paper".

## Basic Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions in order to get to solving!

### 1. Install Docker
This program uses something called *Docker*. While a massive oversimplification, think of Docker as a way to run pre-packaged computer programs mostly agnostic of the operating system you're on (Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.).

- Install Docker Desktop:
  - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) (do not enable Windows containers)
  - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
  - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)

### 2. Download the nyt-crossword-to-kindle Program
1. [Click here to download the program](https://github.com/Justinon/nyt-crossword-to-kindle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Unzip (extract) the zip file you downloaded.
   1. On Windows, use File Explorer
   2. On MacOS, use Finder
   3. On Linux...you know what you're doing
3. Enable viewing hidden files.
   1. [Windows](https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/show-hidden-files-folders-extensions.html)
   2. On MacOS, press `CMD + Shift + .` in your Finder window
   3. On Linux...you know what you're doing
4. Enable viewing file extensions.
   1. [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/common-file-name-extensions-in-windows-da4a4430-8e76-89c5-59f7-1cdbbc75cb01#id0ebf=windows_11)
   2. [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/show-or-hide-filename-extensions-on-mac-mchlp2304/mac)
   3. On Linux...should be visible by default...but you know what you're doing
5. Inside that folder:
   - Find the file called `.env.example`
   - Make a copy of it and rename the copy to `.env`

### 3. Get Your NYTimes Login Cookies
This program needs proof that *you* have a New York Times subscription. That proof comes from your “cookies” (a little file your browser uses to remember you).

1. Install a browser extension that can export cookies. If you use Chrome, [this one works well](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc).
2. Log into [nytimes.com](https://nytimes.com).
3. Use the extension to export your cookies in “Netscape” format.
4. Save that file as `cookies.nyt.txt` and move it into the same folder where your `.env` file and `downloads` folder is.
   - Make sure you enabled viewing hidden file extensions so you don't accidentally make the name something like `cookies.nyt.txt.txt` (note the redundant `.txt.txt`).
   - Compare it to the example file `cookies.sample.txt`—just to make sure it looks similar.

### 4. Create a Throwaway Gmail Account
This program will send crosswords to your Kindle by email. That means it needs your email password. **For safety, don’t use your main email. Use this email only for this program.**

- Create a new “burner” Gmail account
  - Example: `myburneremail123@gmail.com`
- Enable [2FA and create an App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en). You will supply the *app password* to the `nyt-crossword-to-kindle` program, *not* the main password.

### 5. Allow Emails to Your Kindle
Amazon requires you to give permission for who can send things to your Kindle.

1. Go to your [Amazon Kindle settings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX9XLEVV8G4DB28H).
2. Add your new burner email address as an approved sender.

### 6. Fill in the `.env` File
This file is where you tell the program about your setup.

1. Open up the `.env` file in a text editor.
   1. On Windows, use Notepad
   2. On MacOS, use TextEdit
   3. On Linux...you know what you're doing
2. Replace the following `REQUIRED` values (**after the `=`**) with your real information:
   * **`CROSSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS_PREFIX`** → The part of your burner email before the `@`.
   * **`CROSSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS_DOMAIN`** → The part of your burner email after the `@`.
   * **`CROSSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`** → The App Password for your burner email.
   * **`KINDLE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`** → The special email address Amazon gave you for your Kindle
      ([find it here](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email)).
3. Make sure to save the file.

### 7. Test It Out
Let's make sure it's all configured correctly:

1. Open a terminal window (on MacOS or Linux) or a PowerShell window (on Windows).
2. Use the terminal or PowerShell to navigate to the folder where you unzipped the code repository. For example:
   - On MacOS or Linux, type `cd ~/Downloads/nyt-crossword-to-kindle-main` (replace with your actual folder path).
   - On Windows, type `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\nyt-crossword-to-kindle-main` (replace with your actual folder path).
3. Once you are in the correct folder, type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
     ```
     Your program is now running. Lets check its output:
     ```
     docker compose logs -f
     ```
     If everything is successful, it should resemble this:
     ```

4. Now, check your Kindle...it may take a few minutes to appear. If it doesn't, see [troubleshooting below](#troubleshooting).
5. Huzzah! You're done. By default, you'll get your daily crossword at 8am Eastern Time.
   * Crosswords are saved in the `downloads` folder next to `.env` by default.
   * If you want to customize your options further, continue to [Customization](#customization).
   * Otherwise, you can safely close your terminal or PowerShell window.

## Customization

### I want to experiment without sending to Kindle

Good thinking! There is an option to simply download the crosswords to your machine.

Three steps needed: **Disable sending, experiment, and re-enable sending.**

1. Disable sending:
    * By default, `.env` has an entry like this:
      ```bash
      CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games'
      ```

    * You can change it to use the `--disable-send` flag, for example:
      ```bash
      CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games --disable-send'
      ```
    * Save the file.
2. Experiment:
   * Play around with the other [Customization options](#customization) in any combination.
     * NOTE: Make sure to keep the `--disable-send` flag.
   * Follow the [Test It Out instructions](#7-test-it-out) again.
   * Look at the downloaded PDF to see if you're satisfied.
   * Repeat experimenting as much as you'd like.
3. Re-enable sending:
   * In `.env`, remove the `--disable-send` part of the `CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` variable.
   * Save the file.

### I want my crosswords in a different format
By default, your `.env` has an entry like this:
```bash
CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games'
```

There are multiple options you can change it to:
- `--version games` → puzzle on first page, its solution on next page
- `--version newspaper` → classic printed crossword with previous day's solution
- `--version big` → full-page puzzle, clues on next page, solution on the last
- `--version southpaw` → puzzle (left-hand side) on first page, its solution on next page
  
Save the file. The next time your daily crossword sends, it'll be in the selected format.

### I want to download a specific crossword
Three steps needed: **Change your `.env`, re-run the program, and revert `.env` back.**

1. Change `.env`:
    * By default, it has an entry like this:
      ```bash
      CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games'
      ```

    * You can change it to use the `--date YYYY-MM-DD` flag, for example:
      ```bash
      # If you want the crossword from April 20th, 1998:
      CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games --date 1998-04-20'
      ```
    * Save the file.
2. Re-run the program:
   * Follow the [Test It Out instructions](#7-test-it-out) again.
3. Revert the `.env` changes:
   * Remove the `--date YYYY-MM-DD` part of the `CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` variable.
   * Save the file.

### I want to download a lot of crosswords at once
Follow the same [instructions for getting a specific crossword](#i-want-to-download-a-specific-crossword), except instead of `--date YYYY-MM-DD`, use `--from-date YYYY-MM-DD --to-date YYYY-MM-DD`.

For example:
```bash
# All crosswords in May 2005 as a single PDF:
CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games --from-date 2005-05-01 --to-date 2005-05-31'
```

If you want all of those sent as separate PDFs, just add `--multiple-pdfs`:
```bash
# All crosswords in May 2005 as separate PDFs:
CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS='--version games --from-date 2005-05-01 --to-date 2005-05-31 --multiple-pdfs'
```

### I want my daily crossword sent at a specific time each day
One step needed: **Change your `.env`.**

1. Change `.env`:
    * By default, it has two optional entries like this:
      ```bash
      # Your time zone. Select an identifier from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List
      TZ=America/New_York
      # The HH:MM time (in the selected TZ) you want your daily crossword sent to you
      CROSSWORD_DAILY_SEND_TIME="08:00"
      ```

    * You can change it to use your time zone (select an [identifier here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)), and a 24hour formatted time to send. For example:
      ```bash
      # If you want to send at 5pm US Central time:

      # Chicago uses Central time
      TZ=America/Chicago
      # 5pm: 12 + 5 = 17
      CROSSWORD_DAILY_SEND_TIME="17:00"
      ```
    * Save the file.

### Daily News & Home Assistant Summary
This tool now includes a feature to generate a daily PDF containing CBC News headlines and a summary of your Home Assistant status (using Google Gemini).

#### Enabling the Daily News PDF
The news PDF is generated automatically alongside the crossword. It scrapes top headlines from CBC News RSS feeds.

#### Enabling the Home Assistant Summary
To include a personalized "Good Morning" summary from your Home Assistant (weather, calendar, battery levels, etc.), you need to provide a Google Gemini API key and your Home Assistant details.

1.  **Get a Gemini API Key:** [Get an API key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Get a Long-Lived Access Token from Home Assistant:**
    *   Go to your User Profile (bottom left in HA) -> Security -> Long-Lived Access Tokens.
    *   Create a token named "News Summary".
3.  **Update your `.env` file:**
    Add the following lines to the bottom of your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    # API KEY for Google Gemini
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_key_here"

    # Home Assistant Token & URL
    HA_TOKEN="your_long_lived_access_token_here"
    HA_URL="http://192.168.1.100:8123" # Replace with your local HA URL
    ```

#### Sending via Telegram
In addition to email (Kindle), you can have the news PDF sent to a Telegram chat.

1.  **Create a Telegram Bot:** Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram to create a new bot and get a `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2.  **Get your Chat ID:** Message your new bot (or add it to a group) and use a tool like `@userinfobot` or check the API updates to find your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
3.  **Update your `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    # Telegram Integration
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id_here"
    ```
    *   If `KINDLE_EMAIL_ADDRESS` is omitted/blank but Telegram details are provided, the script will **only** send to Telegram (useful for vacations!).

## Customization Examples
The following are `CROSSWORD_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` examples:
- `--version big --date 1999-01-04`
  - Sends the big version of the crossword from January 4th, 1999 to your Kindle.
- `--version newspaper --from-date 2021-08-01 --to-date 2021-08-31`
  - Sends all newspaper version crosswords from August 2021 (as a single PDF) to your Kindle.
- `--version southpaw --date 1999-05-20 --disable-send `
  - Downloads left-handed puzzle version of May 20th, 1999 crossword but does not send to Kindle
- `--version big --from-date 2021-08-01 --to-date 2021-08-31 --multiple-pdfs --disable-send`
  - Downloads all big version crosswords from August 2021 (each as their own PDF) but does not send to your kindle.

## Troubleshooting

If you're encountering an error not listed here, always read what the output says.

### Invalid NYT Cookies
Your output may show lines this:

```
...
crossword-sender  | Checking NYT cookies are present...
crossword-sender  | ERROR: Invalid NYT cookies. Try obtaining your cookies again. Exiting.
```

If you see this, then you misconfigured your `cookies.nyt.txt` file during setup. Typical issues:
1. The cookies file contents aren't similar to what you see in `cookies.sample.txt`. You may need to re-generate the NYT cookies file.
2. The cookies file name isn't `cookies.nyt.txt`. It's possible you aren't seeing the file extension, and your cookies file *actually* got named something like `cookies.nyt.txt.txt` (note the redundant `.txt.txt`).
3. The cookies file was put in the wrong location. Make sure it lives next to the `Dockerfile`, `cookies.sample.txt`, `.env` file, etc.

Try following [this step exactly again](#3-get-your-nytimes-login-cookies).

### Could Not Send the Message
You are probably seeing something like this:
```
SASL authentication failed
Could not send the message.
```

Typical reasons you see this:
1. Your `.env` file has a typo. Did you make sure to split `myburneremail123@gmail.com` into `myburneremail123` and `gmail.com`?
2. You accidentally used the main password rather than the App Password.
   - Make sure you [enabled 2FA and created your App Password](#4-create-a-throwaway-gmail-account), then filled in the `.env` file with *the app password*.
   - Make sure to keep the single quotes. For example, `CROSSWORD_SENDER_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD='super secret password here'`.

## Donations
This tool has been a lot of fun to build. I love maintaining it, but I drink a lot of coffee to do so.

This will forever be a free tool...your donation is never obligatory, but if you want to show some appreciation and keep this alive, we can [virtually cheers over a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=6ZFC75LLTQA3N&no_recurring=0&item_name=Keep+nyt-crossword-to-kindle+%28and+me%29+running+with+a+coffee+%E2%98%95%EF%B8%8F%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F&currency_code=USD).
